### Selecting a Language

After downloading and installing UPrecise, open the software up! There are two languages that are supported with the software. For the scope of this tutorial, we'll be using the software in English. Click on "CH" button to change the default language from Chinese to English.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <table>
    <tr style="vertical-align:middle;">
     <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><a href="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_Language.JPG"><img src="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_Language.JPG" width="600px" height="600px" alt="UPrecise Software Open to Default Language, Chinese"></a></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The language will switch to English similar to the image below.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <table>
    <tr style="vertical-align:middle;">
     <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><a href="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_English.JPG"><img src="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_English.JPG" width="600px" height="600px" alt="UPrecise Software in English"></a></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>



### Connecting the UM980 Breakout Board to a Computer

We will assume that you have a triband multiband antenna connected to the UM980's breakout board and USB cable connected to your computer. Select the COM port that the CH340 enumerated to. There is no need to make a selection in the other two drop down menus by the COM port since the software automatically determines the receiver and baud rate. In this case, it was **COM17**. You may need to [open your device manager to determine which COM port the CH340 enumerated to](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers#windows-710).

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <table>
    <tr style="vertical-align:middle;">
     <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><a href="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_COM_Port_Connected.JPG"><img src="../assets/img/UPrecise_Software_COM_Port_Connected.JPG" width="600px" height="600px" alt="UPrecise Software: COM Port Connected"></a></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Once connected, try exploring the features available on the software as the UM980 sends data to your COM port. You can also check out the UPrecise user manual for more information on the software:
