[*SparkFun Triband GNSS RTK Breakout - UM980 (GPS-23286)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23286)

The SparkFun Triband GNSS RTK Breakout features the UM980 GNSS high precision RTK position module from Unicore Communications. The UM980 is a 1408-Channel GNSS Receiver based on the Nebulas IVâ„¢ that is able to simultaneously track GPS L1/L2/L5, GLONASS L1/L2, Galileo E1/E5a/E5b/E6, Beidou B1I/B2I/B3I/B1C/B2a/B2b, QZSS L1/L2/L5, and SBAS. With this board, you will be able to know where your (or any object's) X, Y, and Z location is within roughly the width of your fingernail. When an RTK solution is reached, the module can achieve a horizontal accuracy of about 8mm (~0.3 inches) and vertical accuracy of 15mm (~0.59 inches). The UM980 is capable of both rover and base station operations.

We've included a rechargeable backup battery to keep the latest module configuration and satellite data available. This battery helps 'warm-start' the module, decreasing the time-to-first-fix dramatically. This module features a survey-in mode, allowing the module to become a base station and produce RTCM 3.x correction data. A SMA connector is included for a secure connection to a Triband GNSS antenna.

Currently, serial UART is only supported on the UM980 module. All three serial UART ports have been broken out to the USB-C connector via CH340, 4-pin locking JST connector, and BlueSMiRF header. Unique pins have also been broken out to the edge of the board. Various jumpers are also included to configure power and LEDs.
